He flashes above-average accuracy when his footwork is sound but he is the definition of a boom-or-bust prospect. He played in a run-heavy scheme that simplified his reads and signaled plays in from the sideline. It doesn't mean he can't be successful running a pro-style offense. It just means that he faces a steeper learning curve. Inconsistent footwork causes him to miss the strike zone too much, and he needs to do a better job of keeping his eyes downfield when forced to move around. Finally, there are the polarizing intangibles. Some question his maturity and ability to win over the locker room at the NFL level, while others point to his record as proof that he's an effective leader. He led his team to a juco championship two years ago and led Auburn to the 2010 FBS championship. <br><b>Video analysis</b>: <a href=""http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=6445236"">Todd McShay</a> <img src=""http://assets.espn.go.com/icons/watch.png"" width=""15"" height=""8"" border=""0"" alt=""Video"" /><br>

As a result, Newton probably will be forced to play early. But if there is a silver lining, this has been a pretty good running team, which can help take some pressure off him early. This is the ultimate roll of the dice. This could be a great pick to turn the franchise around or set the Panthers back for five years.",NA,NA

In terms of physical tools, he has a prototypical frame, strong arm and above-average pocket mobility. 
In terms of his football intelligence, he has a strong understanding of how to run an offense and he makes sound decisions on the field. Finally, there's no question about his ability to step into an NFL huddle and take charge of it. </p>

<p><b>How he fits:</b> This appears to be a perfect fit of a quarterback's skill set with the Colts' new offensive philosophy. Offensive coordinator Bruce Arians will run a Pittsburgh-style scheme with a lot of bunch formations and movement and some no-huddle. Luck will have a lot of freedom to audible at the line of scrimmage. They want to be a much more run-oriented offense which could set up good play action, which is Luck's strength. This is a perfect offense for him, it's just a shame he won't have a better supporting cast in the beginning.

While there are concerns about the pro-style offense, he's done it enough in college that you know he'll be successful in the NFL.
If Luck is 1, then RG3 is 1A. In fact, he has an even stronger arm and he moves just as well. If he stays healthy, he'll be the quarterback Washington so desperately needed and well worth the picks they gave up to get him. </p>

<p><b>How he fits:</b> He is a perfect guy to run Mike Shanahan's offense, which is a strong zone-blocking run game and a passing game that wants the QB to roll out, throw a lot of bootlegs and motion some off play action and that leads to a lot of half-field reads and scrambles, which fits RG3 perfectly. They will also use a lot of motions and shifts and multi-receiver packages to give him a lot of options in the passing game. He will always be a threat to tuck the ball and run. They worked hard to give him a supporting cast in free agency.

There's a good reason Richardson is only the seventh RB to come off the boards in the first five picks in the past 10 years. He's a complete football player. He's a power back who can grind out yards between the tackles, and he's quick enough to get outside to where he can make defenders miss. His ability to contribute on third down makes him that much more attractive considering the direction NFL offenses are heading.

<p><b>How he fits:</b> This was a major need for the Browns. And what separates Richardson from a lot of backs is that he's a three-down player. This offense had no explosiveness or big plays from the running game a year ago and they were at the bottom of the league and yards after contact were an afterthought. That all changes with Richardson. Not only will he be effective between the tackles, but he is also an excellent receiver out of the backfield and he is a good pass-blocker and very effective in blitz pickup. With new offensive coordinator Brad Childress, it will be a West Coast-style offense. They will emphasize the run game to keep pressure off their quarterback position and, as mentioned, Richardson doesn't need to come off the field.</p>

However, he's clearly the best offensive tackle prospect in this class. His greatest strength is his ability to hold up in pass protection. He's quick, athletic and long. While he might not be a mauler, his assignment rarely makes the play when he's run-blocking. </p>

<p><b>How he fits:</b> This offensive line gave up 49 sacks in 2011 and a lot of the big hits that QB Christian Ponder absorbed were over the left side. Kalil has excellent range and he will match up on the best edge rushers in the league. He will give Ponder time to throw the ball. This will also be a run-first offense, and he should be good in the run game and on the second level.

Blackmon has room for improvement in terms of his route-running, but has the natural ability to make those improvements. He's a playmaker who can come down with 50-50 balls downfield and can catch it underneath and turn it into a big play.
He should quickly turn into a No. 1 receiver. </p>

<p><b>How he fits:</b> 
This was the worst pass offense in the NFL a year ago. Of course, part of the problem was QB Blaine Gabbert, however, it has been the worst receiving corps in the NFL for the past few years. The Jaguars did sign free agent Laurent Robinson from Dallas and Mike Thomas has a chance to be OK, but now they have a difference-maker and a guy who can stretch the field. All of a sudden, this pathetic passing game now has a three-wide receiver set and a nickel package that can actually threaten some defenses. This has been a short, conservative passing game in the past because they had no choice. Now, they can air it out with Blackmon or they can let him take those short to intermediate passes where he can run after the catch.

<p><b>How he fits:</b> The secondary was a tremendous weakness to their team a year ago. They tried to address the secondary with free agent Brandon Carr from Kansas City, but that was certainly not enough. They just haven't been a group that can line up successfully in man-to-man schemes, especially versus multi-receiver sets. Under defensive coordinator Rob Ryan, they love to blitz a lot to create pressure, and that puts these corners on an island in those man coverages. Now, the Cowboys have two turn-and-run cover corners they can depend on.

<p><b>How he fits:</b>
The secondary was a tremendous area of weakness a year ago and they just gave up a lot -- they were 31st in the NFL in average gain per pass play -- and plenty of those came between the hashes. Their safeties are nondescript both versus the run and the pass. While this has been a Cover 2 zone-type secondary in the past, we will see more man-to-man looks under new coach Greg Schiano. We actually could see Barron team with Ronde Barber inside in some packages. He is a playmaker in every area. He will give this defense a lot of the big plays they've been missing the past couple of years in both man and zone.

<p><b>How he fits:</b> 
This is certainly a pick that seems to make a lot of sense because the Dolphins know everything about this guy with Miami offensive coordinator Mike Sherman as his former head coach at Texas A&M. Tannehill has a tremendous skill set, but there's a lot of room to develop. Under new head coach Joel Philbin, the Dolphins' offense is a version of a West Coast offense with a large variety of formations and personnel packages, much like he ran at Green Bay as offensive coordinator. This is a sophisticated offense that puts a premium on decision-making and reads, and Tannehill just needs time to recognize matchups, see blitzes and learn how to audible at the line of scrimmage. These are all things he can do, that he will likely sit for a good portion of his rookie season and will learn behind Matt Moore or David Garrard. This is not a QB to start from day one.

This is a combination of a team filling a need but doing it with a great football player. This is a defense that was in the bottom third of the NFL in key categories a year ago. Its best two linebackers -- OLB Thomas Davis and MLB Jon Beason -- are coming off significant injuries. If Beason is healthy, Kuechly could play outside linebacker; if not he can play inside. It not only gives three excellent players at the position if healthy, but it also gives them tremendous insurance. They will be more aggressive in their 4-3 defense this season and they will blitz more and also play some man schemes with their linebackers, all things that Kuechly can do. He is a guy who doesn't have to come off the field in some packages.

<p><b>How he fits:</b>
In past years, this Buffalo secondary has really played well, and in 2011, it was very inconsistent. Part of it was because of injuries and the Bills gave up big chunks of passing yards. Their ability to match up versus spread offenses became a real problem. They are switching from a 3-4 to a 4-3 under new defensive coordinator Dave Wannstedt. Their tremendous upgrades in their defensive front four will give them a much-improved pass rush and Gilmore has a chance to line up maybe against the opposition's No. 1 receiver.

The key to this 3-4 defense is being very physical on the interior and that means a big, dominating nose tackle. They have lived with undersized Kelly Gregg in the past and young Jerrell Powe is unproven and Poe now, potentially, gives them the penetrating, inside run-stuffer they have been looking for. They will tinker with some 43-and-under looks and they will use some pre-snap movement for Poe to get him in some one-on-one penetrating situations. Obviously, the huge question here is which player is he: the guy we saw him at the combine or the guy who can be inconsistent on film?

<p><b>How he fits:</b>
Even though it initially looks like the Eagles are in pretty good shape on the inside of their defensive line, in this Wide Nine defensive scheme, where they really play their linebackers on the edge, it gives the interior of this defense a lot of space to cover. He should be an excellent inside penetrator and a lot of one-gap schemes and the Eagles love to use a deep rotation on the defensive line and come at offenses in waves. Andy Reid will never pass on a good interior player.

After superstar Larry Fitzgerald, there is not a lot to like about this passing game and receiving corps. With Floyd penciled in as a legitimate No. 2 receiver, the Cardinals can move Early Doucet to the slot position, where he is much more suited, and that gives them a legitimate three-wide receiver package and gives them two, big physical receivers in Floyd and Fitzgerald that can go up and get it in the red zone and on third down. This is a pick Fitzgerald will love because it will take away some of the double-teams he's been seeing, and in one move it will make the Cardinals' QBs look better because they will be able to get away with more jump balls.

<p><b>How he fits:</b>
This is a little bit of a curious pick because even though they really need improvement in their defensive front, in this 3-4 defense the feeling was that an OLB who could rush the QB was a bigger priority. Coples is a tall and rangy guy who will likely fit at defensive end in the Jets' 3-4 front, and when they switch to a 4-3 or even some 46 looks, he could be inside or outside because of his versatility as one-gap penetrator. With his skill set he can definitely improve the depth in this defensive line. But expecting a lot of production as an edge pass-rusher is probably expecting too much.

The Bengals have tried this whole offseason to upgrade their secondary that was pretty good a year ago, but there are a lot of questions with age and durability. Their depth is suspect and they just don't match up well in man-to-man coverage. Defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer likes to gamble a lot and bring a variety of blitzes, and he is not afraid to put his corners on an island in man-to-man coverage.

He will likely be plugged in as a pass-rushing outside linebacker in their 3-4 defense. They have looked for a long time for a guy to complement Shaun Phillips, although his production dropped off in 2011 and we don't know where Phillips' game is right now. Free agent Jarret Johnson from Baltimore was an excellent edge pickup and surprising Antwan Barnes had 11 sacks a year ago. On the surface, it looks like this position is in pretty good shape, but the Chargers can never have too many pass-rushers and in 2012, they want to be a more aggressive blitzing defense with those front guys constantly on the move.

If both guys play up to form in 2012, Wright could be the perfect slot receiver inside to take advantage of his quickness, and that would give the Titans a really good three-wide receiver package.

He certainly looks like the QB of the future and that future needs to be now for a 28-year-old. He can make every throw necessary to eventually fit in this West Coast offense and he can make all the required reads. He's coming from a college system in which he ran a lot of spread formations with quick passes and easy reads. And in this West Coast look, his passes will have to become more disciplined and his reads more focused. His ability to handle the blitz must improve dramatically, but having Trent Richardson in the fold could make his job easier. As fast as you want him to get into the lineup, it is likely he will learn in the first half of the season to improve that decision-making behind Colt McCoy.

While he doesn't have the big feet you look for in a franchise left tackle, he's a plug-and-play right tackle. He's got the balance and enough length to hold up on the right side. More importantly, he's a mauler who can move defenders off the ball as a run-blocker. </p>

<p><b>How he fits:</b> 
He will probably learn for a year behind aging LOT Jeff Backus, who was coming off a biceps injury and this will likely be it for Backus. They like young Jason Fox as a swing tackle, but he could easily end up on the right side to improve that position. If Reiff can step in and protect Matthew Stafford's blind side, it will be an nice upgrade to an offensive line that is not great and still has work to do.</p>

<p><b>How he fits:</b> 
Offensive line was the biggest need for this team and DeCastro plays like he was born to be a Pittsburgh Steeler. He can line up next to their only stable lineman, Maurkice Pouncey, and that should really improve their interior run game and also pass protect for Big Ben inside. There's still work to be done on the edge of this offensive line, but this is a major upgrade.

Hightower's got great size at 265 pounds, combined with above-average range and versatility as a pass-rusher. One of his better assets is defending the run on the interior, where he's a hammer taking on blocks and does a great job of tackling with leverage and strength. Great pick.</p>

<p><b>How he fits:</b> He looks like the perfect Patriots player, again, because of his versatility. He can line up at ILB and their 3-4 defense with Brandon Spikes or he could play outside opposite Rob Ninkovich and give them flexibility with Jerod Mayo. He can certainly rush the QB, and this gives the Pats four outstanding linebackers and increases their flexibility in terms of which packages they want to play. Not surprisingly, this is another Alabama pick, which is clear evidence of how much Bill Belichick trusts Nick Saban and his players.

He makes an already productive defensive front even better. Even though the Texans lost their best defensive player in Mario Williams in free agency, they got unexpected production from OLBs Connor Barwin and Brooks Reed. In this 3-4 defense that loves to attack and blitz from all directions with a lot of slants and one-gap penetrating schemes, Mercilus fits nicely as a rotation edge rusher in the 3-4 and possibly a guy who can play DE in 3-4 subpackages.

The Packers have spent a lot of time looking for a complementary edge rusher to Clay Matthews, and isn't it ironic that the guy they picked came from the same school -- USC. This defense had only 29 sacks a year ago and too many of them came from the back seven on blitzes. They need Perry to step in immediately as a starter, and the depth is not nearly what they expected it to be. They really need to hit it on Perry to take the pressure off the secondary.

This defense gave up a lot of big pass plays a year ago, and many of them were inside the hashes. Right now, their two starters are very inconsistent and their depth is shaky at best.

At first glance, this position looks like it has good depth, but there are some question marks even though the foursome of Michael Crabtree, Ted Ginn and newly acquired Randy Moss and Mario Manningham gives them a lot of different options. Look for Ginn to move mostly to being a return guy and Jenkins could step in as a No. 4 receiver in subpackages and could certainly be insurance for Moss if he doesn't produce as expected. Coach Jim Harbaugh loves to give a defense a lot of exotic looks and multiple formations, and he will use more three- and four-wide receiver sets than you think and now he has the personnel to do it.

Under new head coach Greg Schiano, this will be a much more run-oriented offense with improved physicality, and right now, starting RB LeGarrette Blount is a one-dimensional, two-down runner with limited production in the passing game.

Without Brandon Jacobs and with question marks around Ahmad Bradshaw's health and ability to carry the load, the need is for a guy with a complete skill set. While Wilson has good all-around skills, he doesn't dazzle you with power as a runner and he doesn't dazzle you in the passing game.

Interestingly, LOT Branden Albert is their best player and he could fit well inside, which could open up Allen to moving back outside where he played in college. There are some moving parts in this pick, but we know this an offense that wants to run first.

Jeffery's got outstanding size and one of the better sets of ball skills in this year's class. However, a lack of suddenness with his routes brings up concerns about his ability to create separation at the next level.
He should bring an immediate impact in the red zone, though.

</p>
<p><b>How he fits:</b> 
This has not been a receiving corps that the Bears can count on in the past, though they made a major upgrade by trading for Brandon Marshall. There are injury problems with Johnny Knox, no one knows whether Devin Hester be an every-down player, the other guys are developing and there's virtually no threat at tight end. Jeffery's a big guy who should be able to help them initially in sub packages, maybe out of the slot. He should improve them in third-down situations, where they really struggled in the red zone, and he should be a big target for Jay Cutler. In a new run-oriented offense, he may get some nice matchups.

Kendricks makes up for his lack of ideal take-on skills with instincts and quickness. So he beats blockers to the point instead of stacking and shredding. 
His real value is on third down, though. He can both rush the passer and make plays in coverage. 

</p>
<p><b>How he fits:</b>
The linebacker corps for the Eagles was their worst unit a year ago and it wasn't until late in the season that they finally started to jell in their Wide Nine scheme. They gave up a lot of big yards early. They have four young guys outside that have developmental qualities, but are not complete yet. The real question now: are they just backups and special teams guys? DeMeco Ryans is an excellent free-agent pickup from Houston at MLB and he will solidify the front seven. But their need is probably for an OLB that could start and make plays or an ILB who could back up Ryans. Kendricks has experience in both positions, He gives them another interesting young guy to develop. They'll eventually get this position right.

Pete Carroll made it a priority to upgrade the overall speed and explosive plays for their linebacking group, which seemed to be missing last season. Outside starters Leroy Hill and K.J.

<p><b>How he fits:</b>
He is another great example of a player with tremendous versatility, which Bill Belichick loves. He can play corner or safety, man-to-man or zone, and those positions are big needs for the Pats. If he plays inside, their best cover corner, Devin McCourty, can stay at corner full time. If he plays outside, McCourty can move inside full time. Remember, they got free safety Steve Gregory from San Diego, which upgrades their range. Belichick will mix and match and figure out their best skills, and Wilson should give them depth in their sub packages.

He fits perfectly as a physical 3-4 DE in this defense that will not ask him to give them a lot of pass-rush production. Their ends got pushed around a lot and they fell off in the run game.

Steven Jackson is still a very productive back, but he doesn't have a lot of help. In an offense that will now really emphasize the run with Jeff Fisher and Brian Schottenheimer, Pead can be a complementary player who could help the Rams a little bit in the return game and have some production on third down in the short passing game for Sam Bradford.

The concern with Worthy is you don't know what you're getting from snap to snap. At his best he's an explosive upfield disruptive player, against the run and the pass. 
The problem is he can get moved off the ball when he's not playing at his highest level, and there are also concerns about his endurance.

<p><b>How he fits:</b>
Although the Packers don't expect a lot of pass-rush production from their defensive line, this is a position they needed to upgrade. They don't make a lot of plays, although nose tackle B.J. Raji can dominate. They could lose DE Mike Neal for the first four games with a suspension. Worthy looks like he can fit in on a DE rotation and the one thing he may give them is some inside penetrating skills as a one-gap pass rusher, which could be very effective if he's lined up next to OLBs Clay Matthews or first-round pick Nick Perry.

This defense was at the bottom of the league in sacks last season. They made a major upgrade with Kamerion Wimbley from Oakland as a defensive end, and now Brown gives them speed and athleticism as an OLB. He can blitz off the edge and he can make plays in space. He gives them a chance to create turnovers and game-changing plays that they have not had enough of in this defense.

The reason Still didn't come off the board in the first round is inconsistent effort. In terms of natural ability, he has everything you're looking for in a defensive tackle. 
He's quick, he's proven his ability to get off his hands, and he's strong enough to anchor against the run.

He'll play a DT in their base 4-3 defense and a DE when they throw in some 3-4 wrinkles. The Bengals like to use a deep DL rotation and they prefer to attack the QB without a lot of blitzes, although they will as necessary. The thing that makes Still unique is the fact that he has some good inside penetrating skills that can disrupt a quarterback.

At first, this doesn't look like a big need for the Lions as they have an interesting group of players. However, Broyles gives them a chance to upgrade at the slot receiver position. In this offense, they run a lot of short to intermediate routes that are fairly low-risk. Broyles is a guy who knows how to get open and work zones. If he can be that slot guy, he can really open up things outside for Calvin Johnson. He gives Matthew Stafford a consistent target.

This is a good football player who really fills a need. Current OC Todd McClure is probably in his last year and while the Falcons have some serviceable guys, they don't have a guy ready to step in and take McClure's spot.

He is a big, gifted athlete. The reason he dropped this far is well-documented. He probably best fits at LOT because of his feet, but the Steelers recently moved Marcus Gilbert from ROT to LOT.

The Broncos have hopefully learned that as great as Peyton Manning is, he needs a quality backup. He didn't have it in Indy, but Osweiler is that guy in Denver.

The Bills have been looking for a guy to take some pressure off Stevie Johnson. While they had a nice three-receiver package in the first half of last season, it tailed off badly in the last two months. They have good complementary guys, but the need is for a No. 2 on the outside, and Graham may be more suited to play in the slot and as a return guy, but the Bills are already good in the kicking game. He looks more like a depth pick than a No. 2.

Starter Anthony Fasano is adequate but aging, but this offense is going to resemble what we see in Green Bay with a lot of motion and flexes. That's what Egnew can do.

He seems to fit this defense perfectly and he could fill as serious need lining up at NT in a 3-4 defense. K.C. Hampton is near the end with durability issues and backup Chris Hoke has retired.

The Chargers wanted to upgrade the TE position behind Antonio Gates because of age and durability questions. While Green won't give them much help in the run game, they have guys to do that.

The challenge for the Bears is how to use him properly. FB/TE was a forgotten position under Mike Martz, but Mike Tice will bring it back.

</p>
<p><b>How he fits:</b> 
This was a glaring need for the Cardinals. They have tried to solve the OT weakness for years without much success. They gave up 54 sacks a year and a lot of those came off the edge.

On paper this looks like a deep group and a solid rotation. This is a defense that wants to generate most of their pass rush from their front four with no blitzes. However, Kyle Vandenbosch is 34 years old and Cliff Avril is playing under the franchise tag and if not signed under a long-term deal, could leave in a year and the depth is decent at best.

If they play some 3-4 fronts, he could move to OLB and they might tinker with the idea of looking at him SAM position in the 4-3.

Crick has very good initial quickness, both with his feet and hands. While he has just average point-of-attack skills, he brings a lot of upside as a pass rusher. 
</p>
<p><b>How he fits:</b> 
The two starters in this 3-4 defense, J.J. Watt and Antonio Smith, are really productive and their two backups are good versus the run. That gives them a nice four-man rotation but they seem to be missing that edge guy who can make explosive plays. Crick will likely try to compete for a backup job at DE in the 3-4 and his better value may be moving inside when they play a four-man front in passing situations.

</p>
<p><b>How he fits:</b> 
Everybody anticipated that the Giants would address this position in the draft because of two key injuries to veterans to Jake Ballard and Travis Beckum. Though they brought in Martellus Bennett from Dallas there is no assurance they will have their guys back from injury in time for training camp. Robinson has an excellent skill set and a chance to develop, but he's not there yet. He won't add a lot in the passing game.

Ellison isn't much of a big-play threat and he's not a powerful blocker, but he does everything right and hard. One of the reasons he's a good value is he's a great special teams player. 
</p>
<p><b>How he fits:</b> 
This looks more like a special teams pick than to fill a position need. They signed Jerome Felton as a fullback in free agency. While Ellison could contribute there, he's devastating on cover teams and that could likely be his main role unless they go to more two-back sets. He could develop as a lead blocker for Adrian Peterson. The coaches will likely really be intrigued by his motor and look for ways to get him on the field.

He was likely drafted to fill their biggest need: outside linebacker. They lost their best playmaker Kamerion Wimbley as a salary cap move.

Burris could help as an every-down player and especially as an edge pass-rusher.

They lost both backup safeties in free agency and both were also good on special teams. Strong safety Bernard Pollard was basically a run defender and their great free safety Ed Reed still plays at a high level, but he's near the end of his career. Reed has mentored him and he is primarily a box-and-half-field type safety, but his instincts and feel for the game is good. And like the guys they lost, Thompson should help on special teams.

This is an offensive line that could use help all across the board and especially at the tackle position. Age is really a factor in this unit.

</p>
<p><b>How he fits:</b> 
Obviously, Green Bay thinks they need to get more physical inside because they drafted two DTs. The question here is where Daniels fits. They don't get a lot of pass-rush production from their DEs, but does Daniels really fit in the 3-4? He is more of a penetrating one-gap guy instead of a two-gap tie-up blocker types and letting the OLB get all the pressure. He's a good football player but how they use him will be critical.

Safety is a position of need for the Packers, especially since Nick Collins is gone with a neck injury. Their projected starters and backups are not good enough and they'd probably like to avoid moving Charles Woodson inside, though he can help there in some packages.

He plays with excellent balance, does a great job with angles in the run game and has good lateral agility in pass protection. He can continue to get stronger in the lower half and play with more consistent pad level.

They will be a zone-blocking offensive line. They will run stretch plays, draws and misdirection, and that requires guys up front who are athletic in space. Fisher has the best feet at his position in the draft. He will step in immediately at left offensive tackle to protect new QB Alex Smith. If somehow the Chiefs can retain Branden Albert at right tackle, which is unlikely, they will have bookend offensive tackles for the next several years. To the Chiefs' credit, they have spent several draft picks in the past three years on the offensive line, so it's a position of some strength that will only get better with Fisher.",NA,NA

Joeckel is an excellent pass-blocker with above-average feet and balance and also has the power and nasty streak to move defenders off the ball as a run-blocker. And when you consider his SEC experience and the awareness he shows on tape, you don't question his ability to be a starter from day one. <br><b>Video analysis</b>: <a href=""http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=9212524"">Bill Polian</a> <img src=""http://assets.espn.go.com/icons/watch.png"" width=""15"" height=""8"" border=""0"" alt=""Video"" /><br>   
<b>How he fits:</b> The Jaguars have tried to fix this unit over the past couple drafts, but they aren't where they should be. They actually have more holes inside than outside, but Eugene Monroe is acceptable at left tackle, and Joeckel should step in immediately at right tackle. This is another zone-blocking offensive line, but they want a little more physicality in the run game. They must improve their edge pass protection -- they gave up an embarrassing 50 sacks in 2012. The Jaguars front office is from the Bill Polian school of draft philosophy, and that means selecting guys from big schools who have played against elite talent. That certainly describes Joeckel to a tee. This was an easy pick for Jacksonville.",NA,NA

<b>How he fits:</b> The more you look at what the Dolphins are doing on defense, the more this seems like an interesting fit. As a rangy guy who can play a 4-3 DE spot as the Dolphins transition from their old 3-4 front under new coordinator Kevin Coyle, Jordan has excellent edge pass-rush skills. But he also has the athletic ability, when they go to their hybrid 3-4 look, to either rush off the edge or drop into coverage.

There is a lot to like about his positioning, instincts and ball skills in underneath zone, though. As a run defender, he must improve his ability to take on and shed blocks, and become a more consistent tackler. Overall, though, his instincts set him apart because he locates the ball quickly enough to beat blockers to the point, and has more range than some faster linebackers because he gets started more quickly. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> In this 3-4 defense, the Chargers have one solid starter in Donald Butler, but veteran starter Takeo Spikes is gone. His replacement, Jonas Mouton, is unproven. In all likelihood, Te'o will be given every chance to start at left inside linebacker. But there has to be a concern about how he fits into this scheme. He certainly seems to fit better as a 4-3 middle linebacker or even a 4-3 outside linebacker, although he played in more 3-4 looks than you might think at Notre Dame -- so maybe this isn't as big of a stretch as it might appear. The biggest question will be whether he can hold up when taking on blocks if his defensive linemen don't protect him. But for an inside linebacker, he should be able to stay on the field all three downs.",NA,NA

In particular, his footwork and mechanics need work, which will help improve his intermediate-to-deep accuracy, which is inconsistent at times.

Mark Sanchez will probably have one more year -- maybe as the starter -- but with a coaching staff that has a short leash. Smith might be pushed to play earlier than expected.

<b>How he fits:</b> This Bucs secondary has been a disaster in the past couple years -- both in terms of personnel and scheme. For as long as we can remember, the Bucs have played a Cover 2 zone concept, which required physicality, but not turn-and-run cover guys. This coaching staff is trying to play a lot more man-to-man schemes, but it just doesn't have the players to get it done. That leads to allowing a tremendous amount of big plays. Newly acquired cornerback Darrelle Revis goes a long way toward fixing this weakness, but Ronde Barber is near the end of his career and might not be back. The rest of Tampa Bay's corner options aren't very exciting. The edge of this secondary needs speed and the ability to shut down vertical plays. Banks seems to be more of a short-to-intermediate cover guy. So this might not be a perfect fit.",NA,NA

<b>How he fits:</b> The edge of this defensive line, with Charles Johnson and Greg Hardy, is excellent. The interior has been a consistent problem. The Panthers have given up too many inside run plays, produced marginal inside pass-rush pressure and there's very little depth.

<b>How he fits:</b> The coaches have wanted to incorporate more two-tight end sets in recent years. But the backups to starter Jason Witten aren't really pass-catching types. Escobar is a receiving-type player who can move and flex, and he will give this pass offense much more flexibility. Look for Escobar and Witten to continue to run a lot of seam routes, and Escobar should be an excellent matchup receiver. He also provides insurance for Witten, who's still playing at a high level but is entering his 11th pro season.

The Giants also have veteran Shaun Rogers and a young player they like, Marcus Kuhn, who was a rookie in 2012. The only significant player New York lost was Chris Canty.

Still, he is a tough runner who fights through contact and shows good vision between the tackles. Ball's top-end speed isn't elite, but he is quick enough to get around the corner and can make the first defender miss. He is also an underrated receiver who didn't get much chance in that area. He can catch the ball well and transition upfield quickly. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> In the past couple years, this usually dependable Broncos run game hasn't been very productive. Because of inconsistent personnel and injuries, Peyton Manning was forced to run an almost one-dimensional pass offense. Veterans Willis McGahee and Knowshon Moreno are solid when healthy, but durability and age are question marks. Backup Ronnie Hillman doesn't have enough size to be an every-down back. Denver has really needed a back it can count on. Ball has a chance to be a physical, between-the tackles runner with a heavy workload, and that can lead to offensive balance, a much more effective play-action package and the ability to close out a game. This pick should please Manning.",NA,NA

His release off the line stands out, and he hits his stride quickly. He also tracks the ball well and can make athletic catches down the field. Dobson's frame and ability to separate underneath make him an ideal candidate to be a No. 2 receiver at the next level. He is also competitive as a blocker, over the middle and after the catch. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> For the past couple years, the Patriots have had multiple weapons in the short-to-intermediate passing game. But they've been one of the worst offenses in the NFL at stretching the perimeter because they haven't had a deep threat since Randy Moss. New England failed to land Emmanuel Sanders from Pittsburgh as a restricted free agent, so Dobson will be expected to step in and start on the edge. If he can stretch the field like the Pats think he can, it will open up a lot of options underneath. With so many different personnel groupings and sight adjustment as the play develops, Dobson should have success early because he's an instinctive player who has a chance to earn Tom Brady's confidence early in this thinking man's passing game.",NA,NA

Still, he is the kind of player who can contribute in sub packages and make an immediate impact as a returner. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> Corner was an obvious need for this secondary heading into this draft, as the Falcons lost starters Brent Grimes and Dunta Robinson in free agency. The remaining corners, including Asante Samuel, are probably more short-term fixes than long-term solutions. This secondary plays a lot of sub packages -- in fact they play nickel half the time -- which requires a corner depth.

He is a tough, powerful runner, though, who can get yards after contact and punish defenders in space. And while he doesn't look like a blazer on tape, his speed doesn't raise a red flag. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> It seems as if running back is at the top of Green Bay's need list every year, and this draft is no exception. The Packers have tried to manufacture a running game with inferior personnel. They have no offensive balance, and they give Aaron Rodgers very little help. Part of the problem is an offensive line that doesn't run-block very well. Because opposing defenses don't respect the threat of the run game, they can sit back in deep coverages and take away Rodgers' vertical passing game. If Lacy can stay healthy, he can change that.

<b>How he fits:</b> This looks like another value pick, rather than a need, as the Chiefs already have Tony Moeaki and incoming free agent Anthony Fasano. When you look at this offense, the Chiefs probably have a low-level need for a No. 3 tight end who can give them production in the passing game.

<b>How he fits:</b> This offensive line was very stable a year ago, but three of its veteran starters are now gone, which has robbed Detroit of its depth.

He is a playmaker who can hold up in man or zone coverage. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> Outside linebacker hasn't been perceived as a critical need, but this is another value pick. Moore fits perfectly in the 4-3.

<b>How he fits:</b> Under new coordinator Billy Davis, this is a unique 4-3 under defense. Pre-snap, it might look like a 3-4, but the right outside linebacker will walk up, and that provides a four-man pass rush.

In addition, he excels when lined up near the slot, where he maneuvers through traffic well and is an excellent tackler in space. He also provides special-teams value, both as a returner and on cover units. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> This was a good defense a year ago, and the philosophy won't change a lot, even with a new coaching staff. The Cardinals have one elite, shutdown corner in Patrick Peterson, who can take the other team's best receiver out of the game. They added Antoine Cason from San Diego and Jerraud Powers from Indianapolis in free agency. Those three are outside cover players, which should allow Mathieu to play over the slot and contribute in sub packages. In addition, he should be outstanding on special teams, both in coverage and as an electrifying returner. Can you imagine having Mathieu and Peterson as your returners?

<b>How he fits:</b> Starting corners Jason McCourty and Alterraun Verner are decent players, although they gave up more than their share of big plays. Cody Sensabaugh, who was a rookie in 2012, is developing behind them as a nickel guy, but there's not a lot of depth on the edges.

Freeman continues to have inconsistent streaks and make bad decisions, and Glennon has a good enough skill set to potentially develop into a good player.

It's also somewhat surprising that he doesn't play the ball better considering his experience on offense, though that could improve as he gets better at reading quarterbacks and receivers. However, he has the blend of size, speed and fluidity to play safety at the NFL level if he continues to improve.  Even though he isn't a fundamentally sound tackler, he's not afraid to step up and he flashes some pop.  <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> The safety position gave up a ton of big plays a year ago, and they were horrible against tight ends -- especially down the seams.

<b>How he fits:</b> This has been one of the deepest units in the NFL in recent years -- especially at defensive end. The Giants aren't getting quite the same production as they have in the past, although they do get a boost by the projected move of Mathias Kiwanuka back to defensive end from outside linebacker.

<b>How he fits:</b> This is obviously a run-oriented offense with Jamaal Charles who has recovered nicely from an ACL injury, but there is little depth at the position.

<b>How he fits:</b> The Dolphins lost Anthony Fasano in free agency; he was their only real pass-catching TE, but certainly not elite in that area. They replaced Fasano with veteran UFA Dustin Keller, who has virtually the same skill set. The backups are probably better blockers than receivers, although Charles Clay has a chance to give them something in the passing game if he can stay healthy.

The only returning guy is C Fernando Velasco, whom the coaches really seem to like. He can also play guard.

The Redskins secondary gives up too many big plays between the hashes, and tight ends who can run vertical seam routes really expose starting safeties Brandon Meriweather and Reed Doughty.

He has an explosive first step and quick hands, and he uses his length well off the edge. Although his production dropped last season, he was still having a big impact throughout our tape study.  Clowney has to learn to play with a more consistent effort and must develop some technique. However, he is a rare talent and has one of the highest ceilings we've evaluated on tape. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> He has the best skill set in the draft. But will he play that way each week? This is a 3-4 Romeo Crennel defense with a lot of two-gap looks and less penetrating than a one-gap Wade Phillips scheme. That is not Clowney's forte. However, he will play outside linebacker in the base package, and we will see a lot more four-man fronts and sub packages. The Texans will get their best from pass-rushers on the field in passing situations. He has lined up all over the defensive line (&agrave; la J.J.

His initial pop and finishing strength at the line of scrimmage, in addition to his ability to get to the second level and envelop linebackers in space, are outstanding. Although his hand placement is inconsistent and he holds too much at this point, he can get better in this area and is almost impossible to beat when he gets his hands inside and locks on. Auburn's run-heavy scheme raises some concern when it comes to his ability to pick up assignments and his technique in pass protection, but he has the length (35-inch arms), quickness and foot speed to protect the edge working against the league's best edge-rushers when he's fundamentally sound.<br>
<b>How he fits:</b> This is a nice marriage between drafting the best player on the board who also fills a big need. He is an excellent athlete and natural left tackle who will upgrade an offensive line that has not been consistent in pass protection in front of a quarterback who is not overly mobile. This offense will show a lot of no-huddle with three- and five-step drops, and it is mostly a man-blocking offensive line, which suits Robinson perfectly. With left tackle Jake Long coming off a knee injury, Robinson is insurance. With right tackle Joe Barksdale playing better than expected, look for Robinson to line up at left guard to give the Rams an elite left side. He could easily move to left or right tackle if necessary.",NA,NA

He has prototypical size, mobility and outstanding intangibles. He is not a finished product and needs some work with his lower-body mechanics to improve velocity and accuracy. However, he shows excellent poise inside the pocket and has great instincts when extending plays and working off schedule. Bortles' game reminds us a lot of a young Ben Roethlisberger.<br>
<b>How he fits:</b> This is a team with multiple needs, but it has no chance unless it has a quarterback to build around. Bortles will be that guy. Without a legitimate run game and a so-so offensive line, he will be under a lot of pressure. With marginal pass protection and poor blitz pickup, we will see a lot of slants and quick crossing routes with safe passes designed for yards after catch. Bortles will use screen and draw plays and would excel in play-action if the Jaguars can develop a decent run game. This offense likes to attack the middle of the defense, and the coaches are looking for more creativity in the play calling. Bortles is smart and competitive and has some Big Ben similarities.

There's room for improvement when it comes to his route-running, but he's capable of separating from man coverage, as he drops his weight well and accelerates out of his cuts. There's the occasional focus drop, and he can improve his ability to hold on to the ball when the defender times the hit well, but he has the body control, leaping ability and frame to make highlight-reel catches. It's a deep and talented receiver class; it says a lot that he sits atop it.<br>
<b>How he fits:</b> This was the 28th-ranked pass offense a year ago, and veteran receiver Stevie Johnson is the only player the Bills were able to count on. Watkins gives the Bills the big-play capability they have been missing and a vertical presence. We will see creative personnel groupings with a high volume of no-huddle and shotgun plays. They likely will move Watkins all over the formation, with a lot of crossing routes and even some bubble screens designed for yards after the catch. With quarterback EJ Manuel still a bit of an unknown because of injury, these guys should grow together, and their ability to let the coaches install the total playbook will be important.  ",NA,NA

He's just as effective on third down. He's an effective speed-to-power pass-rusher with the upper-body strength to press offensive tackles, drive them back and get off the block in time to make the play. Mack also shows good range in underneath zone, and he's capable of running with tight ends in coverage. The biggest knock is the level of competition he faced playing in the Mid-American Conference. Although he shined against Ohio State, critics are quick to point out he didn't face elite offensive tackles in that game, either. Fair points, but Mack didn't make Buffalo's schedule, and he checks all the boxes when it comes to the physical attributes.<br>
<b>How he fits:</b> This is a 4-3 defense with some unique fronts, and the Raiders can easily go to a 3-4 look, as they are constantly trying to confuse offenses. They have a defense with too many aging players who are not game-changers; Mack could alter that. Their linebackers made a lot of tackles last season, but too many were at the second level. Mack is excellent versus the run, at the point of attack and on a defense that is forced to blitz a lot to create pressure. He can play outside linebacker in a 3-4 look and can be productive as a defensive end when they go to a sub-package from a man front. But his most underrated quality might be his ability to play pass defense (&agrave; la Clay Matthews), and that makes him a safe pick and complete player.",NA,NA

He comes from great bloodlines and is one of the most NFL-ready prospects in this entire class.   <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> He is versatile offensive lineman with four years of experience, and we know about his great family bloodlines. He is a complete player, and the Falcons can play him at a left tackle and move starter Sam Baker to right tackle. Or they can simply play Matthews at right tackle, as he has played both positions. Matt Ryan was sacked 44 times in 2013, and this is a pass-heavy offense that requires good pass protection up front. The Falcons are making the transition from a man-blocking to zone-blocking scheme. They want their offensive line to block in space and be effective in the screen game, and Matthews can do that. But as a unit, they are not great athletes, so we might see more man blocking than we anticipated. With a tough, new offensive line coach, Mike Tice, Matthews will give them some physicality that has been missing.

New coordinator Jeff Tedford is very creative, and we will see a sophisticated scheme with spread sets and a lot of sight adjustments by the quarterback and wide receivers. Evans will work in the middle of the field, and he has a knack for adjusting his routes when his quarterback is in trouble. He might be asked to line up all over the formation in this offense, something he has not done in the past. But he will bring a needed toughness to this passing game.

<b>How he fits:</b> Joe Haden is an elite corner, but he gets little help from the rest of this group. Gilbert gives Cleveland two solid corners, and coach Mike Pettine can now blitz more to create more pressure, as both of these guys can play on an island and play the press technique.  This is a smart defense that asks its players to play a variety of roles, and we will even see a 4-2-5 scheme as its base package at times.

Barr started his career on the offensive side of the ball at UCLA and has just two years of experience on the defensive side of the ball, so he is still developing in terms of instincts. He is one of the higher risk/reward-type players in the class.<br>

The Vikings need to figure out how to manufacture a better pass rush to protect a pass defense that was 31st in coverage a year ago. He can play strongside or weakside linebacker in this 4-3 scheme, and although his physicality is in question, he should be a solid space player in this defense.

He dropped too many passes last year, and his effort is inconsistent, yet he's a good value pick at this point in the first round, and the reason is he's a dangerous receiver. He has the speed to stretch the field and body control to make plays downfield, plus the burst and wiggle to produce after the catch. He's also a nightmare matchup for defensive coordinators.  If you try to match up with a linebacker, he can separate underneath or get behind the coverage. If you try to match up with a safety, he does a nice job of getting inside leverage and using his frame to box out.<br>
<b>How he fits:</b> This was not a real need, with Brandon Pettigrew and Joseph Fauria already on the roster, but the Lions love pass-catching tight ends. Offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi comes from New Orleans and knows how to get big production out of the position. We will see multiple packages with motion, flexes, seven-step drops and go-routes between the hashes. Ebron must be able to flourish in their sight-adjustment package and be on the same page with quarterback Matthew Stafford.

He uses his quickness to take away the edge, he does an excellent job of mirroring when his assignment works back inside and he's strong enough to anchor against power. Though he doesn't have an elite power base and fails to generate push at times as a run blocker, he gets into position, walls off his assignments and blocks through the whistle. He's also a smart player who shows excellent awareness both in pass protection and in the run game. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> This looks a lot like value pick because it doesn't seem like a great need with left tackle Michael Roos and right tackle Michael Oher on board. This is a versatile offense that will ask the line to play man and zone, and it must be better in pass protection. But the Titans will shorten the passing game to get the ball out more quickly to help the guys up front. Lewan can play in both blocking schemes and is excellent in space, which will helps versus speed-rushers. Even though both starting tackles appear to be set, Roos is near the end of his career and Oher does not play with consistency, so there is room for Lewan to step in and compete.

The Giants' receiving corps must be better at sight adjust and must cut down on drops (which can be a small concern for Beckham). He has been in a pro-style college pass offense, and his speed should add up to new vertical routes and open things up for Cruz on crossing routes underneath.

He's a disruptive run defender with rare initial quickness who is at his best shooting gaps and planting ball carriers in the backfield, but he also has long arms (32 5/8 inches) for his frame and the upper-body strength to press blockers off him. His ability to penetrate also makes it tough for quarterbacks to step up in the pocket, and he doesn't have to win with quickness to be an effective pass-rusher, either. He has the violent hands and motor to get to the quarterback when he doesn't win with his first move. <br>

They have two elite defensive tackles in Michael Brockers and Kendall Langford, who are part of a defense that recorded 53 sacks a year ago. New coordinator Gregg Williams loves to attack with loops and stunts, and he really values quickness and penetration -- and that is the name of Donald's game.

He is at his best defending the run, where he takes quality angles in pursuit and flashes the ability to deliver the knockout blow. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> We know Rex Ryan is a defensive-oriented coach who loves to draft defensive backs, and this is a real need for a defense that is excellent up front but struggles in the back end. The Jets want to create more turnovers and big plays. They want to play a lot of tight man schemes, but that does not always suit their current personnel and can limit their willingness to blitz. Pryor is very physical and should eliminate some of the big plays they gave up in the passing game a year ago.

He also has the length (35 inches) and athletic ability to hold up on an island in pass pro when he sinks his hips and keeps moving his feet. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> James might be a little bit of a reach in the first round, but Miami's offensive line was terrible in 2013, and the team had no choice but to go in this direction after giving up 58 sacks a year ago. We will see more zone-blocking concepts with stretch plays, misdirection with draw plays and screens. These are all things that James can do well. He will likely start at right tackle but could slide inside to guard. Remember that center Mike Pouncey is the only returning starter.

Cook compares to Ravens WR Steve Smith with the ability to play in the slot as well as outside the hashes, as he plays bigger than his measureables indicate. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> It is never a shock to see the Saints upgrade in the passing game, but they do have needs at wide receiver. Marques Colston is starting to age, and Kenny Stills is the other starter at WR. Depth is not there for an offense that uses a lot of spread/multi-wide receiver sets. Cooks gives them a guy who can stretch the field with big vertical plays and yards after the catch. He could also be very effective on bubble screens.

Clinton-Dix is the ultimate center fielder and a guy who can run this secondary.

On the plus side, he's a fierce competitor when he takes the field, he has above-average arm strength and he is an escape artist who can buy time for his receivers to get open and break long runs when he gets a lane to scramble.<br>
<b>How he fits:</b> Manziel is a pick who will energize the Browns' fan base, and they were able to get him in a desirable part of the round. Offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan knows how to coach a mobile quarterback because he did so with RG III in Washington, and Manziel has similar qualities.

His slight frame isn't as much of a concern as it is for other corners with similar size, though.  He's a tough run-stopper who tackles well, and he's an aggressive cover corner who's willing to mix it up with much bigger receivers. More importantly, he has excellent man-to-man cover skills and he does a nice job of playing the ball.  <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> The secondary was the Chargers' Achilles' heel in 2013. As a result, the Chargers were forced to play simpler coverages with fewer blitzes and were hesitant to put their corners on an island.

<b>How he fits:</b> Smith is a nice fit in what's a unique Eagles defensive scheme. It looks like a 3-4 front pre-snap, but they will eventually bring one OLB up to the line of scrimmage to make it look like a 4-3 under. Smith is a hybrid guy who has played DE and OLB.

Benjamin must develop as a route runner and displays some inconsistencies catching the football. He is by far one of the bigger boom/bust prospects in this draft. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> This was a glaring need for an offense that is devoid of playmakers in the passing game. Benjamin is a giant wide receiver who will attack the seams -- something the Panthers have not had -- but he's inconsistent. Carolina's passing game is fairly simple without a lot of sight adjustments, and that allows the receivers to run fairly simple routes. Benjamin should be a good jump-ball target and red zone option for QB Cam Newton.

He's a quick-twitched athlete with an above-average combination of suddenness, fluidity and straight-line speed.

<b>How he fits:</b> Denver signed Aqib Talib away from New England, but Champ Bailey and Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie have both signed elsewhere. Tony Carter is more of sub-package corner who contributes on special teams than a starter, and Chris Harris partially tore an ACL in the Broncos' playoff win over San Diego.

Bridgewater's average arm strength is a concern when it comes playing in the NFC North, but he was the top-ranked quarterback on our board at one point and he's a cerebral quarterback capable of mastering offensive coordinator Norv Turner's offense.

<b>How he fits:</b> This is a need pick for a defense that desperately craves a pass rush. Both starting ends (Anthony Spencer and George Selvie) are less than ideal. The Cowboys have a deep-seven philosophy, and that needs pass-rush pressure to come from the defensive ends.

Plus, he didn't run quite as well as expected. So it's easy to see why his stock has dropped since this time last year. That said, he's a very good value at this point, especially considering Scouts Inc.'s top four receivers are all off the board. Lee is a fluid route runner who changes directions quickly without losing much momentum and accelerates out of cuts. He can also produce after the catch and stretch the field.  Plus, he caught the ball far better his first two seasons at Southern Cal. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> The Jaguars had to be ecstatic that Lee was still on the board. WR Justin Blackmon has been a disaster off the field, while Cecil Shorts is entering a contract year and has been plagued with durability issues. The other receivers are just complementary players, so the Jags are in trouble when forced into multi-receiver packages. Lee is quicker than fast and will fit nicely in this short passing game that will feature crossing routes and slants.",NA,NA

He might be small but he's a playmaker -- mainly working out of the slot -- and always seems to be around the football.

He's also got the foot speed to reach linebackers at the second level as a run-blocker and redirect in pass protection. However, he's an unfinished product who hasn't realized upside at this point.

Although Kouandjio played left tackle in college, he probably fits best on the right side -- where the Bills needed an upgrade opposite solid left tackle Cordy Glenn.

Seattle has several candidates at WR, but with the exception of Percy Harvin, none of them are considered elite.

<b>How he fits:</b> Jernigan is tough, physical and can fill a lot of holes in this hybrid defensive front. He can play tackle in the 4-3 and end or even NT in the 3-4. He might be asked to replace Arthur Jones, who departed during free agency. He is not a real two-gap power guy, but his one-gap penetration skills will mesh nicely with this scheme.

<b>How he fits:</b> This might not have been a need, but the Bengals are looking for more production out of their big backs.

Michael Bowie, the 2013 seventh-round pick, started seven games last year and could win the starting job, but bringing in competition makes sense.

Reggie Wayne is great, but age and durability are legit concerns and Hakeem Nicks is an unknown behind outstanding No. 1 T.Y. Hilton. Moncrief, a big target with ""sneaky"" vertical speed, could help elevate the passing attack. Along with Hilton, Moncrief will stretch the field for Andrew Luck and open up the field for the other receivers.

He is also a good on-field leader. The concern with him has to do with his off-field behavioral and maturity issues.</p>
<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> New offensive coordinator Dirk Koetter does an excellent job of adapting his scheme to his personnel, and he knows how to make in-game -- as well as week-to-week -- adjustments. He will put Winston in position to succeed without asking too much of him early, but he prefers to run an up-tempo, no-huddle offense, so he will likely move toward that once Winston gets acclimated to the offense and his teammates.  There's a lot to like from the personnel standpoint, as well.  Wide receiver Mike Evans is a big target who wins 50-50 balls, much like Kelvin Benjamin did for Winston in 2013, plus tight end Austin Seferian-Jenkins is a talented receiver whom Koetter is expected to feature.  Seferian-Jenkins gives Winston a potential playmaker over the middle.</p>",NA,NA

He has a strong arm, a quick release, and he is very accurate when throwing on the run. His ability to improve his accuracy and overall efficiency on throws that require anticipation - as he transitions from Oregon's up-tempo spread system to an NFL offense -- will be critical to his success.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Mariota doesn't fit the mold of prototypical pocket passers -- such as Philip Rivers and Ben Roethlisberger -- with whom head coach Ken Whisenhunt has had past success. Whisenhunt will have to adapt his philosophies toward Mariota's dual-threat skill set early on by consistently using his mobility and changing the launch point as he develops as a pocket passer.  The best-case scenario is if Tennessee is able to get quality play from second-year quarterback Zach Mettenberger early on, providing Mariota some time to sit, watch and hone his craft. </p>",NA,NA

He does a good job setting the edge against the run, has a good motor and is versatile enough to play either on the line or in space as a 3-4 outside linebacker.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong>  Fowler will be used as the LEO within head coach Gus Bradley and defensive coordinator Bob Babich's hybrid system. He will be asked to play multiple roles both from a two- and three-point stance. Fowler has shown the versatility to fill this role both defending the run and adding a pass-rushing presence off the edge. </p>",NA,NA

He suffers from the occasional focus drop but for the most part has excellent ball skills, and he's a good runner after the catch. He's something of a cross between <a href=""http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/11270/jordy-nelson"">Jordy Nelson</a> and <a href=""http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/_/id/8442/roddy-white"">Roddy White</a>.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> After failing to have a 700-yard receiver last year, the Raiders fill a need while also getting strong value here.  Cooper will immediately provide second-year QB Derek Carr with a reliable option who can both create separation underneath and offer vertical capabilities within offensive coordinator Bill Musgrave's system that implements a lot of play-action. </p>",NA,NA

But we wouldn't count out his chances of making it as an NFL tackle, and at worst he projects as an excellent guard. He has very good strength and quickness, and he's the toughest offensive lineman in the 2015 class. He's a tone-setter with a nasty disposition.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Washington had one of the worst offensive lines in the league last year, so it has done well to add one of the best offensive line coaches in the league in Bill Callahan and the best offensive linemen in the draft in Scherff. It's a little unclear where Scherff will line up, considering guard is a pressing need and 2014 third-round pick Morgan Moses struggled at right tackle last year, but Scherff should be a day-one starter regardless of where he plays. </p>",NA,NA

He is an outstanding run defender who also has good quickness, strength and a variety of moves as a pass-rusher. He has a good motor and plays with an edge.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Williams is strictly a value pick here, he's our top-rated defensive prospect. He adds immediate depth as a 5-technique behind Sheldon Richardson and Muhammad Wilkerson, who has been on the trading block. Williams also has the versatility to line up in multiple spots along the defensive line, giving first-year head coach Todd Bowles the flexibility to jump into a four-man front when necessary.</p>",NA,NA

He struggled to catch the ball at times in 2013 but displayed outstanding ball skills last season. His best trait is his ability to win one-on-one battles vertically and in the red zone.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> New offensive coordinator Adam Gase's timing offense requires precise route runners -- and that's one area in which White needs to improve -- but he fills the void created by trading Brandon Marshall to the Jets. Similar to Marshall, White will provide a downfield matchup problem with his size, strength and ability to create late separation, and combined with Alshon Jeffery continue to provide big play-ability outside the hashes for Jay Cutler. </p>",NA,NA

His first-step quickness as a pass-rusher is elite, he's a sideline-to-sideline run defender and he has playmaking instincts. But the complete lack of a power element to his game is a major concern.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Beasley will be used in the hybrid LEO role within head coach Dan Quinn and defensive coordinator Richard Smith's hybrid base 4-3 scheme.  Beasley will play in both a two- and three-point stance. where Smith will look to get him one-on-one matchups in passing situations to help improve a pass-rush that was tied for 30th in the league with 22 sacks. </p>",NA,NA

He has some work to do on his hand placement and technique, but overall he's an effective blocker with excellent toughness and intangibles. He's most likely a right tackle in the NFL but could develop into a left.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Second-year offensive coordinator Ben McAdoo's system requires a quality run/pass balance. Flowers is one of the better inline blocking tackles in this class and immediately upgrades the New York's size and power on the front line. Flowers will potentially start his career inside at guard before making the transition outside as either a right or left tackle.  </p>",NA,NA

But if he can stay healthy he could wind up as one of the best players in this entire class. He's a downhill runner with elite power and balance to go with outstanding breakaway speed. The most underrated part of his game is his pass-catching ability - he has very good hands and is quick to accelerate upfield after the catch.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Gurley is strictly a value pick here. Having played against Marshawn Lynch twice a year, coach Jeff Fisher knows what having a dynamic, big-play runner like Gurley can do for an offense. While Gurley likely won't be fully healthy until the second half of the 2015 season, he will provide a workhorse for first-year offensive coordinator Frank Cignetti, who holds a run-to-set-up-the-pass philosophy. </p>",NA,NA

He played most of his snaps in press-man coverage at Michigan State, and is likely best-suited for a similar role or Cover 2 in the NFL. He's aggressive and physical in run support.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong>  Head coach Mike Zimmer and defensive coordinator George Edwards run aggressive man schemes and value physical press corners with the ability to reroute receivers, making Wayne an excellent fit here. He has all the tools and the technique to push aging free-agent signing Terrence Newman for a starting role on the outside and develop into an ideal complement to 2013 first-round pick Xavier Rhodes. </p>",NA,NA

He commands double teams and makes plays against the run, and is an improving pass-rusher who can push the pocket and is light on his feet for a 339-pound nose tackle. He plays with an edge and good effort and stamina for a guy his size.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Shelton adds size and depth to the interior defensive line and is arguably the best run-stopping defensive lineman in this class. He is insurance for DT Phil Taylor, who is coming off of knee surgery and entering a contract year.

He's a very good run-blocker with good power and a quick first step, and he generally shows good recognition skills. We would have liked to have seen more of a nasty side from him at Stanford.</p>

<strong>How he fits:</strong> Offensive tackle doesn't appear to  be a pressing need at first glance, but left tackle Terron Armstead has had some problems staying healthy and Peat is an excellent value at this point. The Saints could also kick Peat or one of their other tackles inside to guard, where they have a pressing need.  ",NA,NA

He has good overall ball skills and was very productive at Louisville, particularly on deep routes.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong>  The Dolphins fill a need here and continue to add weapons, attempting to aid the development of QB Ryan Tannehill.

He'll win most foot races once he's in the open field. He needs to improve his ball security as well as his pass-protection and pass-catching abilities.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong>  The Chargers were battered by injuries at running back last year, including Ryan Matthews (who is now with Philadelphia).  Gordon provides a major upgrade over Danny Woodhead and Branden Oliver and has the skill set to fit within both a zone- and man-blocking system, which first-year offensive coordinator Frank Reich will utilize. </p>",NA,NA

He can get out-muscled by bigger receivers at times and have trouble getting off blocks in run defense due to his lean frame, so he could afford to get stronger.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong>  Johnson will add depth behind Kareem Jackson and Jonathan Joseph on the outside. He is a strong fit here with the versatility to line up in defensive coordinator Romeo Crennel's scheme, which requires cornerbacks to line up in multiple roles, including both zone and man technique. </p>",NA,NA

He didn't produce much as a pass-rusher but offers good upside in that area, and he was much more disruptive at moving quarterbacks off their spots than his low sack totals would indicate. His motor was a little up and down at Oregon.</p>
<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Justin Smith's decision whether or not to retire will have a big impact here. The 49ers also signed Darnell Dockett, and 2013 second-round pick Tank Carradine could take the next step this year. However, the 34-year-old Dockett is coming off a season-ending ACL injury, and Carradine, who sat out his rookie season recovering from his own ACL injury, played in only nine games last year. In addition, Armstead's ability to anchor against the run at 5-technique and reduce inside to rush the passer makes him a good fit for new defensive coordinator Eric Mangini, who values versatility. </p>",NA,NA

He was dismissed from the UW football program in 2014 after several incidents including run-ins with coaches. But based purely on the tape he might be the best cornerback in this class, with very good athletic ability, size strength and playmaking instincts. He's best in press coverage.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong>  This is strictly a value pick here. Coach Andy Reid and general manager John Dorsey felt the risk was worth the reward regarding Peters' character concerns. Peters is a perfect fit in defensive coordinator Bob Sutton's system that utilizes a heavy dose of press-man technique.  Peters is a projection pick who fills the potential void of CB Sean Smith, who is entering a contract year. </p>",NA,NA

He's a great athlete for the center position with his length and quickness, and his versatility to play multiple spots along the line is a huge asset. He's a good run-blocker but even better in pass protection.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Erving adds depth and, most importantly, versatility along the offensive line. He will likely start his career at right guard next to OC Alex Mack and OG Joel Bitonio, giving the Browns one of the better offensive lines in the league.

He'll never be a big-play threat on contested catch situations, but he's a quick and decisive runner after the catch and as a returner. He has the versatility to fill multiple roles in an offense.</p>

<strong>How he fits:</strong>  The Eagles fill one of their most pressing needs with this pick, and though Agholor is the No. 2 receiver left on our board at this point, he's a safer pick than UCF's Breshad Perriman. Agholor's ability to line up on the outside, work out of the slot and even work out of the backfield will make it easier for Chip Kelly to create favorable matchups without having to make substitutions.

He has an outstanding combination of length and quickness, including excellent mobility as a zone blocker, and he has very good awareness.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong>  Ogbuehi is a pick for the future, as LT Andrew Whitworth will turn 34 this season and both he and RT Andre Smith are entering contract years.

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong>  With Jarvis Jones off to a slow start to his career and James Harrison already 37 years old, the Steelers fill value and need here with Dupree at outside linebacker in Keith Butler's 3-4 scheme.

His range against the run is outstanding, and he does a great job of locating the ball. The concerns we have with him are the lack of a significant power element in his game, the fact that he'll struggle against bigger, stronger OTs, and his lack of experience dropping in coverage.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Defensive coordinator Wade Phillips inherited two of the best edge rushers in business in Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware (whom he coached in Dallas).  However, Miller is scheduled to hit free agency following the 2015 season, and Ware, who turns 33 in July, underwent elbow surgery last year. If Ray can get and stay healthy, stay out of trouble off the field and develop into a productive pass-rusher as expected, it will have been worth it to trade up and get him. </p>",NA,NA

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> This is an intriguing pick considering Arizona allowed just 28 sacks last year, the team's fewest since 2009 (26). Plus, the Cardinals need to improve their ground game and upgrade over right offensive tackle Bobby Massie. Humphries is a left tackle who is better in pass protection than he is run blocking, so it will be interesting to see of the Cardinals move Jared Veldheer to the right side. Humphries isn't a bad value at this point, though, and the Cardinals needed to address an offense that finished 24th in scoring last year.</p>

<strong>How he fits:</strong> Defensive coordinator Sean McDermott can play Thompson at linebacker when he goes to his nickel package, as he often does, and line up Thompson at safety in run-heavy situations.  Thompson should also strengthen Carolina's special teams, and he could fill in at running back in an emergency.  However, Carolina has more pressing needs, and Thompson doesn't have a natural position fit at the NFL level, making him significant reach at this point.",NA,NA

On the other hand, his 14 percent college drop percentage is a major red flag when combined with the issues he had catching some routine passes on tape. The upside is there with him, but so is the risk.</p>

<strong>How he fits:</strong> After losing Torrey Smith to San Francisco, the Ravens were in dire need of finding a big-play, vertical threat on the outside. Perriman fits the bill, as his size-and-speed combination tailor very well with QB Joe Flacco's arm under first-year offensive coordinator Mark Trestman, who likes to dial up plenty of vertical shots off of play-action.

His anticipation and recognition skills are just average, but his size, fluidity and range make up for it. There are a lot of tools to work with here. He could play either corner or free safety at the next level.</p>

<strong>How he fits:</strong>  Dallas fills one of its most pressing needs and adds a player who fits its scheme in Jones, who is a good value at this point. Jones has the size and range to excel in defensive coordinator Rod Marinelli's Cover 2 looks, in addition to the fluidity to hold up when Marinelli mixes in man looks. ",NA,NA

So if you're drafting Tomlinson, you're drafting a right guard. He's not a great athlete but is the best of this year's guard class, and he's a very powerful run-blocker with road-grader capabilities.</p>

<strong>How he fits:</strong> The Lions have a pressing need at guard, and Tomlinson, who is the best pure guard on our board, is a plug-and-play starter. Still, it's hard to be overly complimentary about this pick. Taking Tomlinson, who projected as a late-second-round pick based on our evaluation, this early is a reach. It's also somewhat surprising they didn't address the defensive tackle position, considering that it's also a need and Texas defensive tackle Malcolm Brown was still on the board.  ",NA,NA

He's also a very natural pass-catcher. He needs to refine his route-running technique.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> After adding WR Andre Johnson and RB Frank Gore in free agency, general manager Ryan Grigson continues to surround Andrew Luck with weapons.  Offensive coordinator Pep Hamilton now has a pair of speedsters on the perimeter in Dorsett and T.Y. Hilton -- and both can also line up in the slot.

He has the quickness to hold up on underneath routes and the deep speed to recover from a missed step. He's a playmaker. His range and effort in run support are very good, but he needs to improve against the run overall.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Safety isn't a pressing need, but Green Bay defensive coordinator Dom Capers runs a lot of sub packages and Randall is a tweener safety/corner who projects best at nickelback. He adds much-needed depth to a secondary that lost corners Tramon Williams and Davon House this offseason.</p>",NA,NA

But he has very good pop as a tackler and rare straight-line speed for his size that allows him to make a lot of plays outside the tackle box and when tracking down ball carriers from behind.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> New Orleans had to strengthen the defensive front after finishing 29th in rushing defense last year, and playing the run is what Anthony does best. The Saints traded for Dannell Ellerbe, but he's not an upgrade over Curtis Lofton, whom the Saints made a cap casualty (plus Ellerbe and David Hawthorne both had to take pay cuts). With that in mind, the expectation should be that Anthony is a Week 1 starter.  </p>",NA,NA

He also plays with very good effort. He's just an average pass-rusher at this point, as he lacks the ideal first-step quickness to penetrate gaps and need to rely upon his power.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong>  The Patriots were very fortunate to have Brown fall to them at 32. With longtime NT Vince Wilfork departing for Houston via free agency and 2014 first-round pick Dominique Easley coming off of another knee injury, Brown helps solidify a big need on the interior, while also being a strong fit as New England continues to transitions to a primary base 4-3 front. </p>",NA,NA

He'll have trouble in coverage if he has to match up one-on-one against slot receivers with regularity, but he's athletic enough to cover most running backs and tight ends.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> The only safeties on the Giants roster heading into the draft were 2013 fifth-round pick Cooper Taylor and 2014 fifth-round pick Nate Berhe, so this was their most pressing need. They fill it by taking the best safety on our board in Collins. In addition, the Giants need to bolster a run defense that finished 30th in the league last year, and Collins is at his best stopping the run. </p>

But he is a very powerful blocker in both the running and passing games.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> The Buccaneers got a potential franchise quarterback in the first round and now they address their second-most-pressing need at offensive tackle. While we have Pittsburgh's T.J. Clemmings and Oregon's Jake Fisher ranked higher on our board, Smith has all the tools to improve an offensive line that played a big role in the Buccaneers allowing 52 sacks (tied for third most) and averaging 3.9 yards/rush (24th) last year.</p>",NA,NA

He has the versatility to play at different spots along different fronts. He's a tough player, but his effort is up and down, and there's a concern over how significantly his weight has fluctuated.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Edwards brings a lot of versatility to the table with the ability to line up on the edge, as well as reduce inside in first-year defensive coordinator Ken Norton's 4-3 scheme.

Where he excels is with his lateral agility and acceleration off his cuts. He's very good at making a quick jump cut in the backfield to elude a defender and then explode through the hole. He is solid as a pass-catcher and in protection, but has room to improve.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong>  After signing TE Julius Thomas, Jacksonville continues to surround its second-year quarterback Blake Bortles with offensive weapons.

He was less consistent on short and intermediate routes, and his effort and toughness are question marks.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong>  The Jets find a vertical receiver here who can stretch the field and create space for newly acquired WR Brandon Marshall and Eric Decker to work underneath.  Smith's ability to be a big-play threat will also help prevent defenses from consistently dropping a safety in the box to defend the run game.  First-year general manager Mike Maccagnan has now surrounded Geno Smith with plenty of weapons, and the Jets will quickly find out if he is the QB of the future next season.</p>",NA,NA

His best attribute is as a run defender, but he's an effective power rusher, especially when moved inside to defensive tackle on passing downs.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> It will be interesting to see how new defensive coordinator Joe Barry uses the versatile Smith. He projects best a defensive end in Barry's scheme based on the tape, but he's capable of lining up at outside linebacker based on the way he tested, and he's an excellent pass-rusher when he reduces inside.

Goldman is a perfect fit at nose tackle in Vic Fangio's 3-4 defense, which mixes it up with one- and two-gap schemes. He's an excellent value at this point in the draft and he should help bolster a Bears run defense that finished 17th in the league last year. </p>

His route-running skills are a work in progress, but the primary concerns with him are off the field, as he was kicked off the Missouri football team following several behavioral issues and he missed the entire 2014 season after transferring to Oklahoma.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong>  After selecting his QB of the future in Marcus Mariota, coach Ken Whinsenhunt is looking surround him with weapons.

He has trouble separating on shorter routes, but he's a matchup problem in the red zone and on vertical routes. His ball skills declined during the 2014 season as Michigan's offense struggled.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Carolina needed a No. 2 receiver to complement last year's first-round pick Kelvin Benjamin, and Funchess has the potential to develop into that player, but this is still somewhat of a surprising pick.

He is also an outstanding finisher, unlike some of the other edge-rusher prospects in this class.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> New Orleans finished with 34 sacks (25th overall) and the 25th-ranked pass defense, so adding a pass-rusher like Kikaha was a priority. Defensive coordinator Rob Ryan keeps offenses off balance by varying his looks and playing games up front, so he's capable of creating favorable one-on-one matchups for Kikaha on passing downs.

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong>  The Vikings were in the market for  an inside linebacker to replace Jasper Brinkley, who signed with Dallas, and improve a run defense that finished 25th in the league last year. They get their man in Kendricks, who is the top inside linebacker on our board and will line up next to 2014 first-round pick Anthony Barr giving the Vikings a young, talented linebacker corps.

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong>  The Eagles allowed 21 passing touchdowns to receivers last year, which tied for third most in NFL, and they had already started to rebuild the secondary heading into the draft. Bradley Fletcher and Cary Williams are both gone.  They signed Byron Maxwell and Walter Thurmond, but Thurmond signed a one-year deal and Brandon Boykin is a better nickelback than starter on the outside.

He's strong at the point of attack for an outside linebacker prospect, but he has limited experience dropping in coverage and doesn't have great speed to play in space.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Paul Kruger was the only OLB to have more than two sacks in 2014, which includes 2013 first-round pick Barkevious Mingo (2 sacks). Orchard brings a speed to power element and provides Jim O'Neil with another edge-rushing presence. Cleveland continues to bolster their front seven after losing Jabaal Sheard to free agency to combat the talented backs and strong rushing attacks within the division. </p>",NA,NA

There are only so many human beings his size who can move like he does. But he was completely unreliable at Oklahoma in terms of his on-field effort, particularly on passing plays.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> After signing Ndamukong Suh, the Dolphins continue to add size and power on the interior with Phillips. The hope for defensive coordinator Kevin Coyle is that Suh can light a fire under Phillips, who has an extremely high ceiling, but inconsistencies on tape prevented him from reaching his potential at Oklahoma. </p>",NA,NA

He's an adequate run-blocker in zone-blocking schemes who can take advantage of that athleticism; however, his power base is just average, so he can struggle versus stronger run defenders.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> The Bengals continue to stock pile the offensive line, with both LT Andrew Whitworth and RT Andre Smith becoming free agents after next season. This makes sense to ensure they continue to create room for a pair of the talented young runners in Jeremy Hill and Giovani Bernard while making sure they don't have to put too much on the shoulders of QB Andy Dalton. </p>",NA,NA

He runs angry. He is also the best back in this class at getting in and out of creases. Some backs have elite agility but can't sense holes opening up in time, while others have the instincts but not the quickness to take advantage of it. Abdullah has a rare combination of both. He's a good pass-catcher, but needs to improve his ball security.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> The Lions released Reggie Bush. Theo Riddick could play a bigger role in the passing game with Bush moving, but he's a better receiver than runner. Joique Bell has had problems staying healthy, and he's averaged fewer than 4 yards per carry the past two seasons, so this was a pressing need. In addition, Abdullah is the top back on our board at this point, and he's a good fit for offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi's zone-heavy scheme. Still, this is a bit of a risky pick considering Abdullah isn't built like a bell cow, he's been banged up in the past and the Lions might need him to carry a heavy workload.</p>",NA,NA

He has excellent ball skills and enough speed to stretch the seam vertically, and he generally does a good job of separating from coverage. He gives good effort as a blocker but does better in space than when lined up on the line.</p>

<p><p><strong>How he fits:</strong> The Ravens continue to add weapons for Joe Flacco.  With Owen Daniels leaving via free agency and Dennis Pitta missing the majority of the past two seasons with a hip injury, Williams has the size and athleticism to flourish with Flacco, who is at his best when he has a big target down the middle of the field. </p>",NA,NA

His cover skills are excellent, with his explosiveness and quickness, but he can get exposed by bigger receivers at times.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> The Steelers fill another big need on defense with Golson. After notching just 11 interceptions last season, they needed to find a playmaker in the back end. Golson, who has excellent anticipation skills and production (9 INTs in 2014), will help upgrade them in that department. </p>",NA,NA

He has good strength as a run-blocker and good awareness to locate assignments.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong>  St. Louis needs to improve an offensive line after it allowed sacks on 8.7 percent of dropbacks against four or fewer pass-rushers last season, highest in the NFL, and  allowed pressure (sack or duress) on 33 percent of dropbacks last season, third-highest in the NFL. Havenstein is a bit of a reach at this point, and he's a better run-blocker than pass-blocker, but his ability to move defenders off the ball in this power-heavy scheme should benefit first-round-pick running back Todd Gurley. Plus, he's adequate enough in pass protection to hold up on the right side, where he projects.  </p>",NA,NA

He's a bit of a tweener, however, as he doesn't have elite strength to play defensive end and doesn't have much experience as a 3-4 outside linebacker. But he's a tone-setter with an outstanding motor.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Arizona wanted to get faster at linebacker coming into the draft, and while Golden has average timed top-end speed, there's still a lot to like about this pick. He's a good value pick at this point thanks in large part to his ability to get after the quarterback. The Cardinals finished with 35 sacks last year, the team's lowest amount since 2010.  </p>",NA,NA

He holds up well against speed rushers when his footwork is sound, and he's a good second-level blocker on running plays, but has just average power.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Sambrailo helps fill the void left by the departure of Orlando Franklin. Sambrailo likely projects at right tackle to start his career, which will allow Louis Vasquez to bump back inside, where he is at his best. Continuing to infuse talent on the front line is a wise decision to make sure QB Peyton Manning is protected in his later years. </p>",NA,NA

His inability to add and keep weight is a concern, as is his off-field history. He'll need to get stronger against the run. But he can be a difference-maker as a pass-rusher if he does what he needs to off the field.</p>

<strong>How he fits:</strong> Dallas finished with just 28 sacks (28th) last season, and no player had more than six. The Cowboys also finished 27th in third-down percentage (43.6) in 2014, so improving the pass rush was a priority. While they have already signed Greg Hardy, he is appealing a 10-game suspension, making it important they find a difference-maker like Gregory has the potential to be. Gregory and Hardy have the potential to emerge as one of the most productive edge rush tandems in the league if they can stay healthy and out of trouble off the field. ",NA,NA

He's just so dominant at the point of attack against lesser players that it's hard to gauge whether it will actually translate to the NFL. His agility and speed numbers at the combine were off the charts, but it remains to be seen whether he can handle playing on an island in pass protection in the pros.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Tampa Bay wisely used both of its second-round picks to bolster its offensive line in an effort to protect the first overall pick quarterback Jameis Winston and improve a woeful ground game. The versatile Marpet can line up all along the offensive line, but he fits best on the inside and will likely play guard where the Buccaneers have a need. His quick feet and athletic ability also make him a good fit for new offensive coordinator Dirk Koetter's zone-heavy scheme. </p>",NA,NA

He also doesn't have ideal speed for the cornerback position. But he's a natural playmaker with good size and strength to hold up against bigger receivers, and he's very good in run support.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> The Packers still have Sam Shields, Casey Hayward and nickelback Micah Hyde after losing Tramon Williams and Davon House, but they needed help on the back end. The relatively inexperienced Rollins is a good value here and he's got the tools to excel in the Packers' press-man scheme once he gets acclimated and improves his overall technique. So, taking him when they don't need him to play a substantial role early makes sense.  </p>",NA,NA

There are significant concerns about his behavior off the field though. Michigan dismissed Clark two days after he was arrested and charged with misdemeanor domestic violence and assault in November.  He recently pleaded down to disorderly conduct in that case but it's still a major concern and it's not his first off-the-field incident. Authorities charged him with second-degree home invasion in 2012. </p>

A team captain and three-year starter, Richards has the range to cover a deep half and physical presence over the middle. He also has above-average ball skills and flashes the ability to make plays in coverage. On the down side, he doesn't have the cover skills to stick with NFL slot receivers in man and doesn't get off blocks well enough to regularly line up in the box. </p>

His production dropped off his senior year, but generally he is effective at defending the ball. He's solid in run support but needs to get stronger.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Vontae Davis and Greg Toler are slated starters for next year in Indianapolis, but Smith will bring quality depth. This makes sense, considering Toler is a free agent after next season. Smith has the instincts and versatility to play both outside the hashes, as well as bump inside to the slot, where he will likely see most of his playing time early in his career. </p>",NA,NA

His effort is up and down, but when he's aggressive, he can dominate at the point of attack and drive defensive linemen off the ball in the running game.</p>

<strong>How he fits:</strong> The Titans continue to cater to Mariota by addressing the offensive line. Poutasi played left tackle at Utah but likely projects as a right tackle or at guard in the NFL. While he lacks ideal athleticism, he brings the size and inline power offensive coordinator Jason Michael is looking for in his offensive linemen. </p>",NA,NA

He works hard in the film room, and it transfers to the field.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> After taking RB T.J. Yeldon in the second round, the Jaguars continue to try to help improve their 21st-ranked rushing attack. Cann has ample experience at the highest level of competition and instantly upgrades the interior of this offensive line. The hope is the Jaguars can find more balance on offense, which in turn will help QB Blake Bortles and lower their league-high 71 sacks surrendered in 2014. </p>",NA,NA

His ball skills were much improved as a senior, as was his blocking.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> The Raiders continue to bring in young weapons for their second-year quarterback, Derek Carr. Walford is the most complete tight end in this class and has reliable hands in traffic to provide Carr with a target over the middle.  After lacking playmakers on the perimeter last year, Carr now has two young receiving threats in Walford and WR Amari Cooper to grow with.  </p>",NA,NA

But he is one of our favorite players in this entire class because of his quickness, acceleration and top-end speed, elusiveness in the open field and excellent ball skills.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Doug Baldwin led Seattle with 825 yards receiving in 2014, which ranked 42nd in the NFL in receiving yards -- and no Seahawks WR other than Baldwin caught more than 38 passes. Further complicating matters is that 2014 second-round pick Paul Richardson (ACL) might not be ready for the start of the season. Seattle needed help at receiver and Lockett is a potential difference-maker. He's also capable of giving the return game a much-needed boost. </p>",NA,NA

Most of his separation from coverage happens late, because he lacks ideal quickness to separate on shorter routes.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Strong is the big-bodied replacement the Texans are looking for to fill the void left by Andre Johnson. Strong brings great value here and will be a strong complement for DeAndre Hopkins outside the hashes, with the ability to win in one-on-one contested situations. </p>",NA,NA

His ideal fit is for a zone-blocking scheme. He plays with an edge and with good effort.</p>

<strong>How he fits:</strong> General manager Ryan Pace did a  nice job of signing Will Montgomery, who played for new offensive coordinator Adam Gase in Denver, after releasing Robert Garza,  but Montgomery is clearly not the long-term answer. They signed him to one-year deal, and he's 32 years old.

He has the length and frame to provide depth at all the positions at the NFL level early on his career. He appears to have some upside, as he performed better during agility drills than expected at his pro day. However, he needs to do a better job of sinking his hips and staying square when he's forced to change directions in pass protection. He also has to play with better leverage in the run game.  </p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> General manager Les Snead continues to address the offensive line, and for good reason. Brown is expected to kick inside to guard, where the Rams have a pressing need, but it's worth noting that Brown is a substantial reach. The Rams could have still filled this need without reaching as far as they did. </p>",NA,NA

He reminds us some of Chris Johnson and Jamaal Charles in terms of his skill set and body type.</p>

<strong>How he fits:</strong> Atlanta ranks 31st in NFL in rushing yards per game (86.3) over the past three seasons. The Falcons released Steven Jackson (who had 1,250 yards and averaged 3.6 yards per carry in two seasons with the Falcons), Jacquizz Rodgers left in free agency and 2014 fourth-round pick Devonta Freeman will likely play a bigger role, but he's not a difference-maker.

He's not a great pass-rusher at this point but has the upside to develop into one with his upper-body power, violent hands and closing burst.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> The Giants placed the franchise tag on Jason Pierre-Paul, so they don't have a long-term deal in place. Cullen Jenkins is 34, Robert Ayers is coming off a season-ending injury, and while 2013 third-round pick Damontre Moore made strides last year, he has yet to start a game. In addition,  Steve Spagnuolo has returned at defensive coordinator. He relies on his front four to generate pressure and he values depth up front, so adding Odighizuwa makes sense from a value and need standpoint. </p>",NA,NA

He needs to improve his decision-making, and he played in a scheme that ran a lot of screens and quick-hitters that simplified his reads. However, he was also asked to go through full-field progressions on several throws, and he showed above-average vision on those plays. One area of concern is durability. He's had some problems staying healthy, and he's lean at this point.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Drew Brees is 36 years old -- time catches up with all players at some point. In addition, Luke McCown turns 34 this year, and it's unlikely that 2013 college free-agent signing Ryan Griffin is the long-term answer. Taking Grayson now allows him to get acclimated with Sean Payton's offense and learn from watching one of the best in the league in Brees.  </p>",NA,NA

However, he needs to add polish as a route runner and while he flashes the ability to make the acrobatic catch, his hands are inconsistent on tape. Conley has an extremely high ceiling with the size and raw athleticism to develop into a quality vertical receiver outside the hashes if he can continue to hone his craft.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Even after signing Jeremy Maclin in free agency, wide receiver was still a big area of need for Kansas City, as they did not have a touchdown reception from a receiver in 2014.  Conley is an explosive athlete who provides a vertical threat to stretch the field and loosen up coverage underneath, and provides more room to run after the catch, which is pivotal in an Andy Reid system.  </p>",NA,NA

There's a lot to like about him on the field, particularly his outstanding instincts and recognition skills, which make up for his lack of ideal fluidity and speed. His best fit is in press-man or zone coverages, because he could be a liability in off-man. He's aggressive in run support.</p>

<strong>How he fits:</strong> The Saints signed Brandon Browner to start opposite Keenan Lewis and Kyle Wilson to compete for the nickelback role, but Wilson signed a one-year deal and developmental 2014 second-round pick Stanley Jean-Baptiste doesn't appear ready to push for significant playing time. Williams adds depth and competition and has the potential to develop into a solid player.</p> ",NA,NA

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> If they can stay out of trouble and stay healthy, Aldon Smith and Aaron Lynch could serve as formidable edge rushers for years to come, but the 49ers aren't committed to Smith beyond this year. Ahmad Brooks could also become a cap casualty if he doesn't restructure his contract over the next two seasons. Eli Harold is a good value at this point, he is a good fit at outside linebacker in new defensive coordinator Eric Mangini's base 3-4 scheme, and he has the skills to develop into a formidable edge rusher at that spot. </p>",NA,NA

He's also got the frame and leaping ability to match up with bigger receivers competing for 50-50 balls, but he's not a ball hawk (two career interceptions). He also lacks ideal change-of-direction skills, so he needs to win with physicality to hold own in man working against most receivers. </p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Rashean Mathis re-signed for two years and is expected to start opposite Darius Slay, but he's 34 years old and Carter could be considered his heir. Carter is a good fit for this zone-heavy scheme, plus Nevin Lawson, Bill Bentley and Mohammed Seisay combined for only 89 snaps last year.

While he's tough to shed when he gets his hands inside and locks on, his initial hand placement is highly inconsistent both as a run-blocker and in pass protection. His inconsistencies adjusting to line stunts in pass protection and locating assignments as a run-blocker are also concerning, especially considering he was a four-year starter at Louisville. </p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> The Bills needed to add youth and depth on the interior.  Miller has a quality inline power base to drive and steer defenders off the ball when in position, which is exactly what offensive coordinator Greg Roman is looking for in his power-blocking scheme. This is a good pick by the Bills, as Miller also brings the toughness coach Rex Ryan wants in his ground-and-pound philosophy. </p>",NA,NA

He's a tweener who doesn't have ideal top-end speed for a 3-4 outside linebacker or size for a 4-3 defensive end prospect. He's a slightly better fit at 3-4 outside linebacker, where he has the upper-body strength and enough bulk to set the edge. While he's not going to win many battles with pure speed, he's got enough quickness, power and balance to make an impact rushing the passer.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> First-year head coach Todd Bowles is a defensive-minded guy, so it comes to no surprise that he continues to address the front seven. Outside linebackers Calvin Pace, Quinton Coples and Jason Babin combined for just 13.5 sacks in 2014, and the need to find more pass-rushing production is evident. Mauldin has upside as a pass-rusher and has the potential to upgrade New York's presence off the edge. </p>",NA,NA

He still has some developing to do with his technique and awareness, but he shows adequate mirror skills in man coverage to potentially add depth to a secondary. </p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> After Shareece Wright departed via free agency, the need to add depth at cornerback behind Jason Verrett and Brandon Flowers was clear. Mager is an instinctive player with the versatility to play inside the slot and will have an immediate impact on special teams.  </p>",NA,NA

However, he's on the lighter side for an inside linebacker prospect and struggles to anchor when he gets caught in a phone booth. He's also an inconsistent tackler with just adequate stopping power. Finally, he has had some problems staying healthy in the past, and Texas' decision to suspend him before the Longhorns played in the 2012 Alamo Bowl raises concern about his off-the-field decision-making. </p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> The Eagles traded for Kiko Alonso this offseason, and he is expected to start opposite the talented Mychal Kendricks. DeMeco Ryans will provide excellent depth as well, so inside linebacker doesn't appear to be much of a need at first glance.  However, Kendricks, who has been the subject of trade rumors, is entering the final year of his rookie contract and Ryans, who turns 31 this year, is coming off a season-ending injury. Hicks is an excellent fit on the inside with the ability to push for a starting role early in his career in the Eagles' 3-4 scheme. </p>",NA,NA

He's just an average blocker, as he makes the most of the strength he has but can still get overpowered on occasion.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Offensive coordinator Hue Jackson utilizes a lot of two-tight end sets, and with Jermaine Gresham likely not returning, Kroft makes sense here. He is one of the more complete tight ends and a quality blocker, who can open up creases for RBs Jeremy Hill and Giovani Bernard. </p>",NA,NA

Still, he's an effective runner, and he is a highly productive pass-catcher out of the backfield. He has very good vision at the line of scrimmage and in the open field.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Arizona needed a big back to complement Andre Ellington, who landed on injured reserve with a sports hernia injury last year (only the Browns and Raiders averaged fewer yards after contact per rush than the Cardinals in 2014). While he doesn't have elite power for a bigger back, Johnson still picks up yards after contact thanks to his effort and size. </p>",NA,NA

His effort was up and down, but he played big in Auburn's biggest games. The weakest area of his game is his pass-catching ability. He made some spectacular catches but was inconsistent.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Coates is another vertical threat who caters to QB Ben Roethlisberger's big arm. The Steelers continue to load up at the receiver position and now have two burners outside the hashes with Coates and Martavis Bryant that take attention away from their No. 1 wideout, Antonio Bryant. </p>",NA,NA

He's a strong edge-setter against the run and plays with outstanding energy and toughness.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Everson Griffen had breakout year after signing an extension, and Tom Johnson re-signed for three years, but 32-year-old Brian Robison's sack production dipped last year, so adding a defensive end makes sense. Hunter is a good value at this point, and he has the potential to develop into a dangerous pass-rusher in time. </p>",NA,NA

While he needs to develop as a decision-maker, he flashes the ability to work through his progressions and has functional mobility within the pocket to buy time. He also has quality arm strength and can be accurate at all three levels when he's on balance and has room to throw. Mannion has similar traits to Tampa Bay QB Mike Glennon and could end up sticking in the league for 10 to 12 years as an adequate backup with a chance to develop into a starter.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> The Rams traded for Nick Foles this offseason, but he's in the last year of his contract, missed the final eight games of the 2014 season with a broken collarbone and didn't play nearly as well to start the season as he did in 2103. Backups Austin Davis and Case Keenum haven't shown they can be successful long-term starters, either.

He has an outstanding combination of height, weight, length and athleticism. He is very disruptive against the run and as a pass-rusher with his quickness and strength, and he can play multiple positions in multiple defensive fronts. But his motor is very up and down.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> The Ravens have stockpiled defensive linemen in recent years, as Davis is the 12th they've selected in the past six drafts. Davis provides depth left by the departure of Haloti Ngata and will bolster Baltimore's interior and help them continue to be stout against the run, as they ranked fourth in rush defense last season. </p>",NA,NA

Humphries during the pre-draft process, but the team captain and three-year starter has prototypical height and weight with adequate arm length for a right tackle prospect. He gets into position and flashes the ability to move defenders off the ball as a run-blocker. He has some problems dealing with speed rushers, but he also flashes the ability to push speed rushers past the pocket and recover when he gives ground to speed-to-power initially in pass protection.   </p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Dallas re-signed right offensive tackle Doug Free to a three-year deal, but he's 31 years old, missed five games last year and underwent ankle surgery following the season. While he's expected to be ready to go for the 2015 season, backup Jermey Parnell, who filled in well last year, left in free agency. The Cowboys' offensive line is the best in the league and a big reason for their success last year, so getting an insurance policy if Free gets hurt again makes sense. Green has the potential to develop into a starting right tackle in time. </p>",NA,NA

He battled injuries and was used mainly as a blocker this past season. This helped him improve, as he showed better technique and was much more assertive over the course of the season. Heuerman is an underrated athlete and has a chance to be a much better pro than college player. </p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> After signing Owen Daniels and James Casey via free agency, the Broncos continued to add depth at the tight end position. Heuerman is an underrated athlete and should make an immediate impact as an inline blocker in the run game. Heuerman is an insurance pick, as Daniels has had problems saying healthy and Casey's production has dipped over the past two seasons. </p>",NA,NA

He is a disruptive pass-rusher with the strength to collapse the pocket when he reduces inside, and he gets his hands in throwing lanes even when he can't get to the QB. He's a limited athlete but an effective, hard-nosed player.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Corey Redding and Ricky Jean-Francois departed in free agency and DT Arthur Jones has struggled to stay healthy, so there is a need to add bodies along the front line. Anderson fits the mold, as he has the length to line up at 5-technique and create disruption within defensive coordinator Greg Manusky's base 3-4 scheme. </p>",NA,NA

His timed top-end speed is just average, and he's not an elite vertical threat who regularly takes the top off the coverage, but he flashes the ability to turn on the jets when he gets a seam as a ball carrier. The biggest area of concern is his hands. He drops passes he should catch and fights the ball too much despite the fact that he has a big hand span.</p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Receiver isn't a pressing need after re-signing Randall Cobb, but Green Bay makes a value pick here and gives Aaron Rodgers yet another weapon by taking Montgomery. In addition, Montgomery is a dangerous return man who should give the Packers' kickoff return unit a much-needed boost. </p>",NA,NA

He is a determined runner that possesses quality pad level, power and balance to pick up yards after contact.  While he isn't a dynamic runner, Jones has quick feet, adequate lateral agility and flashes the versatility as a receiving threat to provide quality depth at the position. </p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> Jones is a little bit of a reach here, but not by a lot and he fills a need for Washington.

Grissom will have limitations if asked to consistently play in space as a 3-4 OLB. </p>

<p><strong>How he fits:</strong> The Patriots covet versatility on defense and Grissom fits the bill. He has experience playing with his hand in the dirt and in a two-point stance, which plays well into defensive coordinator Mattt Patricia's hands.

On the other hand, there's no questioning his potential, as he has everything teams are looking for in a left tackle prospect, in terms of natural ability. He has a quick first step, changes directions well, has excellent arm length and has bulked up to 312 pounds.  ",NA,NA

He engulfs defensive tackles and flashes the ability to drive them off the ball in the run game, plus his rare arm length and wide frame make it tough to get around him in pass protection. The problem is he started just 11 games over the past two seasons, and he didn't play football until his junior year of high school. He lunges and ends up on the ground too much at this point. In addition, his weight is a blessing and a curse. His ability to control it and stay in shape will be crucial to his success.  ",NA,NA

In his final two seasons completed 63.8 percent of his throws with 78 TDs compared to 20 INTs (3.9-1 ratio). Goff has first-round physical tools, as well as high-level football intelligence and work ethic, which is why he might be the top QB selected in 2016. But in order to sustain success in the NFL, Goff must improve his consistency with lower-body mechanics (which will lead to better ball placement) and continue to add bulk his frame. -April 1, 2016","<b>What he brings:</b> Goff is an experienced three-year starter who is one of the most natural passers in this class. He has excellent pocket presence and feels pressure naturally to buy time while going through progressions. Goff shows accuracy and touch with the ability to deliver from an uneven platform. He has added weight and that eases concerns about his durability. He might need time adjusting to an NFL playbook coming from a wide-open system. He is one of the top two quarterbacks in this class and has the tools and acumen to develop into an above-average starter. <br>

<b>How he fits:</b> Goff is more NFL-ready than Carson Wentz with more starts and experience against a higher level of competition, which likely factored into the Rams' decision.  Coming from Cal's ""Bear Raid"" spread system, Goff will need time adapting and learning an NFL playbook. The good news for Goff is that the Rams have an excellent defense and a Pro Bowl RB in Todd Gurley they can lean on while Goff develops in the early going. -- Kevin Weidl

Wentz only started 23 games at the FCS level, but he earned a 20-3 record. There's no questioning his football intelligence, maturity and leadership skills.

However, Wentz has the tools, football intelligence, maturity and leadership skills to develop into a quality starting QB in the NFL.

Bosa lacks elite speed off the edge (verified by 4.86 40 at Combine) but the rest of his physical traits range from good to elite, and he shows the relentlessness and instincts shared by most top-level NFL pass rushers. -April 5, 2016","<b>What he brings:</b> He's the best edge defender and arguably one of the top two prospects in this class. Bosa displays heavy and active hands and possesses excellent core strength, along with the instincts to find the ball and finish plays as a run stopper. While he doesn't have elite quickness or bend, he is a relentless pass rusher who brings strong speed-to-power ability and the versatility to kick inside and cause disruption. He brings a great motor and approach to the game and will instantly upgrade a defensive front. 
<br>
<b> How he fits:</b> We felt Bosa's best fit was as a DE in a base 4-3 scheme, but he has the size, power and versatility to line up in multiple spots along their 3-4 scheme.

At this point, he's more of a positional run-blocker who will need to continue to get stronger and play with more aggression in this area. The second-best offensive tackle in this class, Stanley should be ready to step into a starting role from day one. -- Kevin Weidl
<br>
<b> How he fits:</b>  We had Ole Miss offensive tackle Laremy Tunsil ranked ahead of Stanley, but this is an excellent pick nonetheless. The Ravens need an upgrade at left offensive tackle, where Eugene Monroe has missed 15 games over the past two seasons.

The bottom line? He is a durable and productive defender, whose versatility will allow him to play multiple spots along the D-line. <br>

He tested extremely well at the combine including a 5.00 in the 40-yard dash while his jump and agility testing were all above-average as well.

Though his sack production dipped in 2015, he played as more of an off linebacker where he showcased his range as a space player in coverage. He will bring immediate help on third downs and should quickly push for a starting job. <br>

While he's strong in run support, Apple will get pushed around at times by bigger WRs when in coverage and his ball skills are a work in progress.

He has to get stronger and improve his ability to match up with bigger receivers, but he has the frame to bulk up and develop into an excellent press corner.

But he has the aggressiveness and confidence to overcome his lack of ideal measureables, which will allow him to develop into a quality starting CB on the outside. He projects as an early first round selection. --March 23, 2016","<b>What he brings:</b> Hargreaves is an undersized cornerback who is one of the most instinctive and natural man coverage cornerbacks in this class. He shows smooth and balanced movement skills to mirror receivers, and he displays excellent anticipation and ball awareness. On the flip side, he lacks ideal measurables and doesn't have elite top-end speed, which brings up some concerns about his downfield range against elite receivers at the next level. Overall, he has the football intelligence, the movement skills and the willingness in run support to develop into a quality starting cornerback outside the hashes or become one of the better nickelbacks in the NFL. <br>

This scheme will allow him to minimize the downfield range concerns and allow him to line up outside the hashes, while also letting him maximize his playmaking anticipation and ball skills to manufacture turnovers.

<b> How he fits:</b> The Steelers needed to infuse youth and talent into a secondary that struggled to find any consistency and ranked 30th in the league in 2015. Burns is a strong fit within defensive coordinator Keith Butler's press-zone scheme due to his length, speed and range.

He has a big time arm and he has a playmaker's mentality.

He played in a scheme that simplified his reads, and he doesn't always see the entire field despite his height. He fails to locate the open man at times. <br>

<b> How he fits:</b>  Trades with the 49ers and/or the Eagles never materialized and Mark Sanchez isn't the long-term answer at QB, so general manager John Elway fills the Broncos greatest need by taking Lynch. Lynch is a developmental prospect and this is a bit of a reach, as he needs to work on his ability to read coverages and isn't ready to start right away.

Though he's not as effective defending the run, he has the frame and size to set the edge. On the downside, Dodd didn't test as well as expected at the combine, and his lack of production heading into his senior season raises a red flag. He has also had problems staying healthy. <br>

He also brings strong value on third downs with the athleticism to hold up in coverage, and he is an underrated blitzer.  The recovery of his knee injury will determine his success at the next level, however he could end up being the steal of the draft if he is able to return to the caliber player we studied on tape. <br>

Henry has excellent power and balance as a runner and is an absolute nightmare to tackle when he gets to the second level where he shows deceptive top-end speed to outrun pursuit. He is high cut though, which hampers his lateral agility and ability to make defenders miss and he becomes far less effective when defenses are able to create penetration.

There's also a lot to like about his versatility as he's strong, long and athletic enough to play defensive tackle in a base four-man front and defensive end in three-man fronts. Robinson's downside is he doesn't play every snap with the same kind of urgency, and he's an unpolished pass-rusher who isn't an effective hand fighter at this point. -- Steve Muench

He ran a slightly quicker time at his pro day (4.53), however, and that time is a more accurate reflection of his playing speed. In addition, the 40 time overshadowed an otherwise impressive combine performance as he tested well in other key areas. The bottom line is that Thomas has the frame, athletic ability and ball skills to develop into an effective No. 2 wide receiver, but he still needs to improve his route running.

On one hand, his size, arm strength and the potential he showed as a freshman make him an intriguing Day 2 prospect.

On the other hand, his underwhelming tape, career completion percentage (56.1 percent) and ball placement are significant concerns. <br>

<b> How he fits:</b> The Jets have a pressing need at quarterback considering Ryan Fitzpatrick remains unsigned, Geno Smith isn't the long-term answer and Bryce Petty may never develop into a starter.

Murray was the No. 9 overall pick by the Oakland Athletics in the 2018 MLB draft. If selected in the first round of the NFL draft, Murray would become the first athlete to be selected in the first round of both drafts. He is an aggressive playmaker but also displays good overall decision-making skills and shows poise under pressure. Murray has fast eyes when making full-field progression reads. He displays natural touch and timing as a passer, throwing accurately from a variety of different arm angles. He really excels at off-balance throws but he gets into trouble when he falls off of throws, typically when the pocket is collapsing. He has a quick trigger and a strong arm. There is an elite combination of quickness and speed, and he is arguably the most explosive QB prospect since Michael Vick. He does an excellent job of sensing defenders and protecting his undersized frame by sliding. His eyes drop when scrambling at times, which leads to him missing some open targets. In the right system, Kyler can be a good NFL starter and an electrifying playmaker at the quarterback position. But there are unique risks if using a first-round pick on Murray, including his lean frame, his lack of experience and his option to bail on football in pursuit of a promising baseball career at any moment. -- March 19, 2019","Murray is an aggressive playmaker with a strong arm, quick release and elite quickness, yet he is also a sound decision-maker who stays poised under pressure and isn't easily rattled by mistakes.

While there's an argument for sticking with last year's first-round pick (Josh Rosen) with that in mind, giving Kingsbury the player who best fits his system makes more sense -- and Kingsbury has long been enamored with Murray's skill set. Kingsbury will adapt his offense to his quarterback, so the more dynamic the QB, the more dynamic the offense -- and Murray is the most dynamic QB in this class. Still, the offensive line needs to play better than it did last season for Murray to realize his considerable potential. <i>-- Steve Muench</i>",NA

The pick of the former Vanderbilt standout follows the Colts' selection of Michigan's Kwity Paye in the first round (No. 21) on Thursday. This is just the second time in the common draft era that the Colts have used each of their first two picks on defensive linemen, according to ESPN Stats &#x26; Information research. They last did it in 2002 when they selected Dwight Freeney and Larry Tripplett. Odeyingbo had 12 sacks in his career at Vandy, including 5.5 in 2020. It's uncertain when the Colts will see him on the field after Odeyingbo tore his Achilles while training earlier this year. <i>-- Mike Wells</i><br><br><b>More:</b> <a href=""https://www.espn.com/blog/indianapolis-colts/post/_/id/26340/indianapolis-colts-nfl-draft-picks-2021-analysis-for-every-selection"" rel=""noopener"">Analysis for every Colts pick</a> <style>div.draftTable__content > p > a{color:#06c !important; border-bottom:1px dotted #06c !important}div.draftTable__content > p > a:hover{opacity:.8 !important; border-bottom:1px solid #06c !important}</style> ",NA
